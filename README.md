# Quantixy — Schrödinger’s Proxy
Quantixy is proxy which auto-sleeps and wakes Docker containers when the website is reached. Containers are both running and not running until someone checks.



Let me know if you want:

a logo mockup (sci-fi, minimal, retro, etc.)

a badge for GitHub

a CLI command wrapper (quantixy start, etc.)

or a one-liner installer/setup script (for sharing)

This is ready to be a cool open source tool if you want to publish it.
